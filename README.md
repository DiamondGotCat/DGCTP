# DGHTP  
DiamondGotCat Hypertext Transfer Protocol

## What is this?

**DGHTP** is a next-generation communication protocol inspired by traditional HTTP/HTTPS,  
but built for **speed, security, and simplicity**.

It was designed as a lightweight, high-performance protocol based on my earlier project, **UltraDP**.  
With built-in support for **encryption**, **compression**, and **chunked transfer**, DGHTP enables  
secure and efficient data exchange — even under difficult network conditions.
